# PTFE Tube Improvements to Avoid Clogs

## Modifications to the Original PTFE Tube

**Remove the zip tie near the extruder and move the clip further back.** The PTFE tube has a rather steep entry angle to the extruder, which often causes clogging issues. By removing the zip tie and moving the clip backwards, we can improve the entry angle.[^1]

## Modifications to the Upper Chassis

**Remove the top glass latch or add a riser.** By improving the entry angle of the PTFE tube, it’s likely to collide with the glass, which will eventually lead to wear on the tube.

The best thing you can do is print a Riser.
- [Official Artillery Riser](/media/stl/official_m1_pro_riser.zip) – Also available on the printer’s MicroSD –. Artillery sells a lighting and fan kit for this Riser – Available on their [Website](https://artillery3d.com/products/height-extension-kit-m1) and their [Aliexpress store](https://aliexpress.com/item/1005009972236549.html) –. This Riser is ideal for PLA and PETG, as it can be opened to improve ventilation and even provide air extraction with the kit.
- [Diogenes Riser](/media/stl/diogenes_m1_pro_riser.zip) – [Available on Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/1381869-riser-for-artillery-m1-pro) –. This Riser is fully enclosed and more robust, making it ideal for technical materials that generate higher temperatures and require the printer to remain closed.

## PTFE Tube Replacement

> Check the [PTFE tube replacement guide](/en/guides/ptfe-tube-change) if you are going to replace it.

You can replace the original PTFE tube (internal diameter 2.5 mm, external diameter 4 mm) if it has been damaged or you want to improve filament sliding:
- [Replacement tube supplied by Artillery](https://artillery3d.com/products/ptfe-tube-m1).
- [Capricorn replacement tube](https://www.captubes.com/shop/#!/Filament-Guide/c/173671010) (internal diameter 3 mm, external diameter 4 mm). The best PTFE tubes on the market.
- [Mellow replacement tube](https://aliexpress.com/item/1005008268651680.html) (internal diameter 3 mm, external diameter 4 mm). Proven good quality.
- [Mellow low-friction star-shaped replacement tube](https://aliexpress.com/item/1005010202912335.html) (internal diameter 2.2 mm, external diameter 4 mm). Although it has a Bowden-specific internal diameter, its star design provides less friction; however, **it does not seem advisable to use with TPU or abrasive materials** (the star-shaped design may end up causing more friction than a conventional design with these filaments)[^2].
