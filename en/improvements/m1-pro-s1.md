# History

Since its release to the market, the Artillery M1 Pro has had a series of hardware design issues.

- Clogging problems due to the poor angle of the PTFE tube, the extruder inlet, and the pressure applied to the filament.[^1]
- Heated bed issues: poor leveling[^2], electrical leaks[^3].
  - Artillery published an [official announcement](https://www.artillery3d.com/pages/official-announcement)[^4][^5] regarding this issue, stating that it only occurred in some units from the first production batch.
- Problems with the chamber temperature sensor, which reported temperatures far from the real values (around 10 degrees lower).

# Artillery announcement

In response to these issues, Artillery finally published another [official announcement](https://www.artillery3d.com/blogs/news/latest-announcement-regarding-the-m1-pro)[^6][^7] on November 28, 2025, announcing a free M1 PRO S1 upgrade kit for all Artillery M1 Pro owners **–unless it is second-hand–.** There is no information about the deadline to request the upgrade kit.
