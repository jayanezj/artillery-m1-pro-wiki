# The PTFE tube
This tube is used to guide the filament from the spool to the extruder.

## Required parts
<table>
<tr>
  <th>Part</th>
  <th>Image</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>

- **One-way connector:** This connector prevents the tube from moving outward from the extruder.
  - You can reuse the one included with the original PTFE tube.
  - The [Artillery kit](https://artillery3d.com/products/ptfe-tube-m1) includes spare connectors.
  - You can get a compatible connector on [Aliexpress (ptfe embedded bowden collect)](https://aliexpress.com/item/1005009105267126.html).

- **Clamp on the silicone sleeve:** Ensures the passage from inside to outside the machine. The outer diameter of the silicone tube with the PTFE inside is around 5.3mm.
  - You can reuse the one that comes preinstalled.
  - You can get a compatible replacement on [Aliexpress (White Hose Clamps 5~5.5mm)](https://aliexpress.com/item/1005005697827712.html).

- **PTFE tube:** This tube guides the filament from the spool to the extruder, so we must use a tube with a slightly larger inner diameter (2.5~3.0mm) than what is used in Bowden systems (1.9~2.2mm).
  - [Replacement tube supplied by Artillery.](https://artillery3d.com/products/ptfe-tube-m1)
  - [Capricorn replacement tube](https://www.captubes.com/shop/#!/Filament-Guide/c/173671010) (3mm inner diameter, 4mm outer diameter). The best PTFE tubes on the market.
  - [Mellow replacement tube](https://aliexpress.com/item/1005008268651680.html) (3mm inner diameter, 4mm outer diameter). Proven good quality.
  - [Mellow low-friction star-shaped replacement tube](https://aliexpress.com/item/1005010202912335.html) (2.2mm inner diameter, 4mm outer diameter). Although it has a Bowden-specific inner diameter, its star-shaped design provides less friction; however, **it does not seem advisable for TPU or abrasive materials** (the star-shaped design may end up causing more friction than a conventional design with these types of filaments)[^1].

- **PTFE tube disassembly tool:** This tool allows us to remove the PTFE tube from the extruder.
  - It is available on the printer's MicroSD card.

## Guide

> Artillery provides a [guide in their Wiki](https://wiki.artillery3d.com/m1/maintenance/add-the-ptfe-connector-assembly) for changing the tube.

### Preliminary steps

We must remove the filament before starting and disconnect the machine from power.
  
### Removing the PTFE tube

<table>

</tr>
<tr>
  <td>

1. Remove the white clip that secures the sleeve on the outside of the printer.

  </td>
  <td>

  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>

2. Using the extraction tool, pull the tube out of the extruder.

  </td>
  <td>

  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>

3. Disconnect the connector clips and remove the zip tie near the extruder (if still present).

  </td>
  <td>

  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>

4. Remove the clip from the one-way connector and pull it out by pressing on the extruder side.

  </td>
  <td>

  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>

5. Pull the PTFE tube from the inside toward the outside. The one-way connector found at the end of the PTFE tube on the exterior only allows extraction from the extruder outward, so **we must not force the reverse direction** (this will damage the tube).

  </td>
  <td>

  </td>
</tr>

### Installing the PTFE tube

<table>
<tr>
  <td>

6. Insert the one-way connector that will go inside the printer. The area where the blue clip is placed is the one closest to the printer wall.

  </td>
  <td>

<a href="/media/images/change-ptfe-tube-step-6.webp" target="_blank">![change-ptfe-tube-step-6.webp](/media/images/change-ptfe-tube-step-6.webp =640x){.align-center}</a>
    
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>

7. Insert the PTFE tube into the extruder and adjust the tube length by moving the extruder across the entire bed.

  </td>
  <td>

<a href="/media/images/change-ptfe-tube-step-7.webp" target="_blank">![change-ptfe-tube-step-7.webp](/media/images/change-ptfe-tube-step-7.webp =640x){.align-center}</a>
    
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>

8. Attach the connector clips and secure the one-way connector with the blue clip.

  </td>
  <td>

<a href="/media/images/change-ptfe-tube-step-8.webp" target="_blank">![change-ptfe-tube-step-8.webp](/media/images/change-ptfe-tube-step-8.webp =640x){.align-center}</a>
    
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>

9. Attach the white clamp to the silicone sleeve. **Do not overtighten the white clamp; only tighten it enough so that the PTFE tube does not move.**

  </td>
  <td>

<a href="/media/images/change-ptfe-tube-step-9.webp" target="_blank">![change-ptfe-tube-step-9.webp](/media/images/change-ptfe-tube-step-9.webp =640x){.align-center}</a>
    
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>

10. Pass the PTFE tube through the final one-way connector.**

  </td>
  <td>

<a href="/media/images/change-ptfe-tube-step-10.webp" target="_blank">![change-ptfe-tube-step-10.webp](/media/images/change-ptfe-tube-step-10.webp =640x){.align-center}</a>
